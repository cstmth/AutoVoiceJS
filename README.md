## A few words

Armed with a Java course and the idea of AutoVoice, I started my software development career back then. I was and still am aware that such bots already exist, but no bot puts as much emphasis on quality, reliability and a nice look as AutoVoice does. That is what makes AutoVoice better.

AutoVoice Java version taught me some important things: starting from object orientation to SQL databases, everything was there. I learned a lot. And also that backups are important: So one day I deleted the existing AutoVoice database. The bot was still in the development phase and user data was therefore not affected. Well, that was the end of the AutoVoice Java journey. Here is the corresponding repository: [AutoVoice](https://github.com/cstmth/AutoVoice)

This bot is expected to do what AutoVoice Java has done even better and add a good bit on top of it.
